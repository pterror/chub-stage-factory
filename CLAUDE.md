# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the chub-stage-factory repository.

## What This Is

A self-contained Claude Code workspace for shipping **one** Chub stage. Clone it, co-design the stage with the user, fill in `DESIGN.md`, then let the autonomous loop implement and deploy it.

The skeleton under `src/`, `public/`, and `.github/workflows/` is forked from [CharHubAI/extension-template](https://github.com/CharHubAI/extension-template). The deploy workflow auto-creates the Chub extension on first push to `main` and writes the assigned `extension_id` back into `public/chub_meta.yaml`.

## Origin

Scaffolded as a deliberately single-use repo. Chub stages are small enough that each one wants its own workspace — design notes, test data, deploy credentials, the whole thing scoped to one artifact. A monorepo of stages would couple their lifecycles; a generic template would lose the design context. The factory pattern keeps each stage's history honest: one repo per stage, the `DESIGN.md` is the actual design, the commits are the actual implementation.

The two-phase split (co-design then autonomous build) exists because the load-bearing decisions are in Phase 1. Once `DESIGN.md` is concrete, implementation is mechanical — the autonomous loop is doing work the user shouldn't have to sit through.

## Self-contained

This repo ships its own slash commands under `.claude/commands/` — `/design-stage` for Phase 1, `/build-stage` for Phase 2. (`/loop`, invoked by `/build-stage`, is a built-in Claude Code skill.)

## Two-phase workflow

### Phase 1 — Co-design (interactive)

The user opens this repo and describes what they want. Ask clarifying questions until `DESIGN.md` is filled out concretely enough that an autonomous loop can implement it without further input. **The bar for "concrete enough": every field in `DESIGN.md` is filled, and the gameplay/UX is unambiguous.**

When the user runs `/build-stage`, Phase 1 ends. Do not start implementing during Phase 1 — design fidelity matters more than speed.

### Phase 2 — Autonomous build

Driven by `/build-stage`, which invokes `/loop` (self-paced). Each iteration:

1. Read `DESIGN.md` and `STATUS.md` (creating `STATUS.md` on first run).
2. Pick the next unchecked item from `STATUS.md`'s task list, or generate the task list if empty.
3. Implement it. Edit `src/Stage.tsx`, `src/TestRunner.tsx`, `public/chub_meta.yaml`, etc.
4. Run `yarn build` to verify it typechecks and compiles. Fix errors before moving on.
5. Commit with a conventional message. Push.
6. Update `STATUS.md` (mark done, note blockers).
7. End the iteration. The loop schedules the next.

Exit the loop when `STATUS.md` shows all tasks complete and the latest push passed the deploy workflow.

## Chub stage API

Stage class lives in `src/Stage.tsx`, extends `StageBase<InitStateType, ChatStateType, MessageStateType, ConfigType>` from `@chub-ai/stages-ts`. Lifecycle:

- **`constructor(data: InitialData<...>)`** — receives `characters`, `users`, `config`, `messageState`, `chatState`, `initState`, `environment`. Set internal fields. No async work here.
- **`async load()`** — runs once after construction. Returns `{ success, error?, initState?, chatState? }`. `success: false` disables the stage. Procedurally-generated static content (map, roster) belongs in `initState` here.
- **`async setState(state: MessageStateType)`** — called when the user swipes/jumps to a different message. Restore message-scoped state from `state`.
- **`async beforePrompt(userMessage: Message)`** — fires before the LLM call. Returns `{ stageDirections?, modifiedMessage?, messageState?, systemMessage?, chatState?, error? }`. `stageDirections` is an ephemeral prompt-append; `modifiedMessage` replaces the user's text; `systemMessage` shows in the log and is sent on the *next* LLM call.
- **`async afterResponse(botMessage: Message)`** — fires after the LLM responds. Same return shape.
- **`render(): ReactElement`** — pure React render. Triggered after every hook.

`Message`: `{ content: string, anonymizedId: string, isBot: boolean }`.

### Three state layers — pick correctly

| Layer | Lifetime | Use for |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `initState` | Set once in `load()`, immutable | Procedurally generated static content (map layout, NPC roster) |
| `messageState` | Per message; restored on swipe/jump via `setState()` | Player position, HP, emotion — anything that changes per turn |
| `chatState` | Whole chat graph (all branches) | Fog of war, meta-narrative flags. **Use sparingly.** Most state belongs in `messageState`. |

Ephemeral UI state (animation frames, hover) lives in plain class fields, not persisted.

## Manifest — `public/chub_meta.yaml`

Hand-edit:
- `project_name`, `tagline`
- `visibility`: `PUBLIC` | `PRIVATE` | `UNLISTED`
- `position`: `ADJACENT` | `NONE` | `COVER` | `FULLSCREEN`
- `tags`
- `config_schema` (JSON schema for the user-facing config form)
- `state_schema.init/message/chat` (optional but recommended)

Auto-filled by the deploy workflow on first push, do not write yourself:
- `extension_id`
- `github_path`

## Local dev

```sh
nix develop          # provides node@21.7.1 + yarn (via flake)
yarn install
yarn dev             # http://localhost:5173, runs src/TestRunner.tsx
yarn build           # tsc + vite build → dist/
```

`src/TestRunner.tsx` is the dev harness — it instantiates the Stage with `src/assets/test-init.json` because there is no real chat UI locally. Update the test data as the design evolves.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions on push to `main`/`master` or `v*` tag. Requires repo secret `CHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` (get one via the [Chub token API](https://api.chub.ai/openapi/swagger#/User%20Account/create_projects_token_account_tokens_projects_post)).

First push:
1. Workflow creates the Chub extension via API.
2. Writes `extension_id` into `public/chub_meta.yaml` and commits back.
3. Zips `dist/` and uploads to `https://api.chub.ai/extension/{STAGE_ID}/upload`.

Subsequent pushes: build → zip → upload.

**Before pushing for real**, confirm `CHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in the GitHub repo settings. The workflow fails fast if not.

## Reference stages

Curated for pattern coverage. Read the one closest to what you're building before writing from scratch.

| Repo | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| [Lord-Raven/statosphere](https://github.com/Lord-Raven/statosphere) | Config-driven stat tracking + LLM-classification scripting engine. The general-purpose flagship — read first if your stage has variables. |
| [Lord-Raven/bar-keeper](https://github.com/Lord-Raven/bar-keeper) | Small, focused mini-sim built around one card. Good reference for a tightly-scoped stage. |
| [CharHubAI/expressions-extension](https://github.com/CharHubAI/expressions-extension) | Emotion classification → image swap. Reference for visual-feedback stages and using `afterResponse` to update render state. |
| [lloorree/maze-extension](https://github.com/lloorree/maze-extension) | Procedural map generated in `load()` (`initState`), player position in `messageState`. Reference for mini-games with persistent geometry. |
| [dieerlking/simple-hypnosis](https://github.com/dieerlking/simple-hypnosis) | Prompt injection via `stageDirections` to shape narrative tone over time. Reference for non-UI stages that modulate the LLM. |

## Hard rules for Phase 2

- Don't ask the user questions. If `DESIGN.md` is ambiguous, make a reasonable choice and note it in `STATUS.md` under "decisions made autonomously".
- Don't skip `yarn build`. A broken build wastes a deploy cycle.
- Don't `--no-verify` anything.
- Don't commit `node_modules/`, `dist/`, or anything in `.gitignore`.
- Commit per logical chunk, not per file. Conventional commit messages.
- If a build error persists across two iterations, stop the loop and write the blocker to `STATUS.md` for the user.

## Context Is The Only Scarce Resource

Every byte that enters the main session stays in the main session for its entire lifetime. File contents, command output, search results — once read, it lingers in cache and shapes every downstream token. There is no "just looking."

**All exploration runs in subagents.** Investigations, audits, surveys, "let me check," "let me find" — if the purpose of a tool sequence is to find out something you don't yet know, it runs in a subagent. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the raw output stays in the subagent.

Reading a reference stage's source to understand a pattern is exploration — spawn a subagent and have it return the pattern, not the source.

## Durability

Subagent reports, mid-session realizations, "I'll remember this" — none of these outlast the session. Anything worth keeping goes into `DESIGN.md`, `STATUS.md`, code, or a commit.

**Commit completed work immediately.** Uncommitted work is lost work. In Phase 2, every iteration ends in a push — that is the durability mechanism.

## Authenticity

When asked to analyze a reference stage, read it. Do not synthesize from conversation memory or what the stage probably does.

**Something unexpected is a signal.** A build error you don't understand, a deploy that succeeded without `extension_id` being written back, a `messageState` that didn't restore on swipe — stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.

## Discipline

Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. A single correction does not warrant a CLAUDE.md edit. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly and the rule names the failure it prevents.

Do not announce actions ("I will now…"). Act.
